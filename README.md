# MetaGNN-MAML-Replication
MetaGNN-MAML-Replication is a PyTorch replication of the Meta-Learning GNN Initializations for Low-Resource Molecular Property Prediction framework, focusing on architectural fidelity over performance. It combines a GGNN encoder with MAML-style meta-learning for molecular property prediction under limited data conditions.
